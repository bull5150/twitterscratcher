# Twitter Scratch Pad

Trying out twitter api in a console.  

- Basically took Karpach (https://www.karpach.com/twitter-application-only-authentication.htm) example and made it my own by flipping   the tweets out into lists as well as using newtonsoft to parse the json.

- Also added an example of the search by Geo Location.

- Added a term search
